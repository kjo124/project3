Cabbage,"Cabbage or headed cabbage (comprising several cultivars of Brassica
            oleracea) is a leafy green or purple biennial plant, grown as an
            annual vegetable crop for its dense-leaved heads. It is descended
            from the wild cabbage, B. oleracea var. oleracea, and is closely
            related to broccoli and cauliflower (var. botrytis), Brussels
            sprouts (var. gemmifera) and savoy cabbage (var. sabauda) which are
            sometimes called cole crops. Cabbage heads generally range from 0.5
            to 4 kilograms (1 to 9 lb), and can be green, purple and white.
            Smooth-leafed firm-headed green cabbages are the most common, with
            smooth-leafed red and crinkle-leafed savoy cabbages of both colors
            seen more rarely. It is a multi-layered vegetable. Under conditions
            of long sunlit days such as are found at high northern latitudes in
            summer, cabbages can grow much larger.",Cabbage.jpg
Eggplant,"Eggplant (Solanum melongena), or aubergine, is a species of
            nightshade grown for its edible fruit. Eggplant is the common name
            in North America and Australia, but British English uses the French
            word aubergine. It is known in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and South
            Africa as brinjal.",Eggplant.jpg
Leek,"The leek is a vegetable, a cultivar of Allium ampeloprasum, the
            broadleaf wild leek. The edible part of the plant is a bundle of
            leaf sheaths that is sometimes erroneously called a stem or stalk.
            Historically, many scientific names were used for leeks, but they
            are now all treated as cultivars of A. ampeloprasum. The name
            leek developed from the Anglo-Saxon word leac. Two closely
            related vegetables, elephant garlic and kurrat, are also cultivars
            of A. ampeloprasum, although different in their uses as food. The
            onion and garlic are also related, being other species of the genus
            Allium.",Leek.jpg
