<!-- Displaying Federation Status

Your site also should provide a page fedr_status.php that provides immediate
visual feedback regarding the status of every site in the Federation Master
List. Exactly how you format this display is up to you, provided you work into
your display the following:

    The short name of each site.
    The long name of each site.
    A prominent color encoded status indicator for each site. There are three
    possible colors

There are actually three possible states and with each a color:

    Green: Site responded as open when asked through their ajax_status.php page.
    Red: Site responded as closed when asked through their ajax_status.php page.
    Yellow: Site has not responded to an AJAX call to their ajax_status.php
    page.

Notice that this page is not something a Customer would generally want to see,
but it will be handy as a visual indicator of what other sites are up and
running: something you will want to know as you start pulling ingredient
content from these other sites. -->
